bref:
NYT Spelling Bee Solver in C++

verbeux:
An attempt to generate a solution for NYT Spelling Bee type problems with minimal execution time.
Currently completes in ~30ms with default compiler optimizations (-O0) reading an ~8000 entry dictionary

Why ...
... c++? I am not good at it but I would like to be.
... do I continue to let the knicks do this to me? Unclear.
